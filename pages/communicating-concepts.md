## Reference Decks as Communication Tools

Once you have decided which design concept(s) to forward, take a pause. Carve out time with your stakeholders and leadership to present your design direction.

As you schedule, use the time to polish the deck for the design concept you all voted on. Create a deck that paints the picture of your idea accurately, succinctly, and rigorously. Explain why this idea is a good idea to go with.

This presentation meeting is not about validating a project plan or timeline; it's about aligning on the design concept. Before you can articulate a timeline, you need to make sure you're pursuing a design direction that stakeholders and leadership agree with and can sponsor. If you don't have that alignment, even the best project plan will result in failure.

### Framework - Communication Deck

While a formated framework for a communication deck isn't possible, a good starting point for this deck would be:

- **Slide 1:** Name of Design Concept
- **Slide 2:** Points from Discovery research this concept solves for
- **Slide 3:** Reference 1 for this Design Concept. Explain why or to what part of the concept this reference speaks. Is it form? Function? Content? Delivery Channel?
- **Slide 4:** Reference 2 for this Design Concept. Answer the same questions as above.
- **Continue** with references until you've painted a well-rounded picture of your design concept's expression.
- **Final Slide:** Reiterate using points from Discovery research why the team chose this design direction.

Finally, **take questions** from the stakeholders. Steer the conversation away from operational questions at this time. Ensure your stakeholders know that you will make a realistic timeline and need in the next step, but for right now, you want to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the utility of this design direction and the wisdom of pursuing it.
