## Making Methods

The methods you use to start making your design concept into design expressions depends on what your concept is. Look back at your references: what is the nature of the expression you're creating, based on that collection of references? Is it a product? A service? A system? Or is it more complex than that, like a large service that needs multiple products to support it?

If you're unsure, review the <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/website/hcd-guide/design/designed-things.htm">Designed Things</a> section of the Design Phase Concept Guide, where you'll find explanations of the nature of Products, Services, and Systems.

### More Design Methods
