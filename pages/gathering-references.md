## Gathering References

Now that you have your design ideas generated and your constraints mapped, the team can start thinking about what those design ideas might look like in the real world.

### The Purpose of References

The purpose of using references, whether drawn, photographed, recorded, collaged, et cetera, is to meet four primary goals:

* To **explore** nuances in a proposal, system, or idea.
* To **understand** those nuances.
* To **clarify** those nuances, especially if they act within a complex system.
* To **communicate** the steps above to others who may or may not be present in design meetings.

References help design teams show each other and their stakeholders their ideas. By accompanying these collections of references with words, whether written or verbal, the team can more easily understand what it collectively is thinking or what an individual teammate is thinking, keep a record of that thinking, and edit the idea.

### Using References

In the Design Phase Concept Guide's <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/website/hcd-guide/design/envisioning-ideas.htm">Envisioning Ideas</a> section, we talk about references as means by which to talk about the emotions and/or general direction the design seeks to evoke.

In addition to this function, references can also be used to help the team understand greater specifics of the team members' ideas and communicate those ideas to stakeholders. In this way, references do double duty: emotional references can show how a design concept revolves around giving people a sense of community, for example, while in this section, we show how references can also be used to forward the team towards a first design expression, also known as a low fidelity prototype.

## Framework - Building a Reference Deck

Each member on the team should use the reference deck framework below to build references for their design concepts that they would like to forward into design expressions. Print out as many frameworks as you need to. Use the following directions to move through this activity.

Take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to build your reference decks. You can pull references from the internet, cut them from publications, take photos and print them, draw them, or otherwise record them. Accompany your references with text to describe what contribution the reference is making to the design concept. This is not a collage: it is a thoughtful compilation of real-world examples to show your team mates your ideas.

## Decide What Concept(s) to Forward

Reconvene as a group to discuss and decide on the design concept(s) the team will forward to physical expression. Facilitate the discussion and decision-making through the following steps:

1. Present your reference decks to each other, using step 4 of the Top Five divergent thinking activity, <a href="https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/HCD-Design-Operations-Guide/divergent-thinking-1/">Question Time</a>.
1. Use the Notes framework to record the name and some details about each proposed design that the team generates.
1. Silently vote on the expression you would like to forward to a low fidelity prototype. If there is a tie and you have time and bandwidth to forward more than one expression, do so. The additional thinking will result in a better, more meaningful design solution for participants.
1. If you do not have time or bandwidth to forward more than one design expression, discuss the possbilities through the lens of your project constraints and decide as a team on the best expression to forward.
